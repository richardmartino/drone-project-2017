# My drone project from 2017

This is the github page for my drone project that I wrote about on my website. [You can see that article here](https://richardmartino.me/projects/drone-project-2017-suny-ulster/).

You can see every photo, diagram and video I've used for the article as well as all of the source files for the parts. I'll include .stl files as well if you just want to print what I made without modifying.
